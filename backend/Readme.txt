How to start the server:
This was made using Visual Studio Code, so assuming you are using that or something similar...

1. Navigate terminal to the backend directory
2. type the following:
   nodemon server
3. You should see:
	Server is running on port: 3000
	MongoDB database connection established successfully
   If you see error @notjohn on discord

you should be able to connect to the server via localhost:3000 or the specified port.

nodemon is a script that will update the server every time you save a file. To exit, press ctrl + c
